<h4>Library</h4>

Two elements define an outstanding library: great resources and the right atmosphere. The SSN Central Library offers our students both factors.<br><br>

With a catalogue of over 84000 volumes and 20000 titles and an online journal database with a link to IEL (IEEE & IEE), ACM, Science Direct, SpringerLink.com and EBSCO, the library offers students a wealth of knowledge resources to aid in their quest for knowledge. The library stocks 206 national and 114 international journals and magazines to keep students abreast of the latest findings and research. And the resources are constantly being expanded, with around 1,200 books added each semester. To add to the wealth of options, SSN also has institutional membership in the libraries of IIT-Madras, Anna University, British Council, MALIBNET (Madras Library Network, Chennai) and DELNET (Developing Library Network, New Delhi).<br><br>

Our library is not limited to textual resources. We also offer 110 NPTEL video lectures and 129 web courses in various disciplines, which can be accessed throughout the campus via our intranet. Students can also connect with interactive lectures through Anna EDUSAT Ku-Band.<br><br>

As for the right surroundings for serious study, the library is completely air-conditioned, spacious, and designed to be a quiet, contemplative space. Open from 8.00 a.m. to 8.30 p.m., the library’s extended working hours make it easy for students to fit library research time into their demanding academic schedules.<br><br>
